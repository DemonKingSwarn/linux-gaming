How to run games on Arch (and configure Steam and Proton).

* Enable Game Mode scheduling

Game Mode configures CPU governer, scheduler, and process niceness for maximum performance for games. To enable Game Mode:

1. First enable the =multilib= repo if you haven't already. Edit =/etc/pacman.conf= to add
   #+begin_src
     [multilib]
     Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
   #+end_src

2. Synchronize the repos by =sudo pacman -Syy=

3. Install Game Mode
   #+begin_src
     sudo pacman -S lib32-gamemode gamemode
   #+end_src

4. You can run Game Mode by running =gamemoderun= command.

5. Create a new user group with =sudo groupadd -r gamemode=.

6. Add yourself to the group by =sudo usermod -aG gamemode <your username>=.

7. Edit system security limits for users =sudo nvim /etc/security/limits.conf= to add the line:
   #+begin_src
     @gamemode      -        nice         10
   #+end_src
This will enable user accounts that are members of the gamemode group to increase (or 'renice') processes to a value of 10.

8. Now test everything is working by running =gamemoded -t= and fix any errors (hopefully none).

* Installing Stuffs

** Wine-Staging
#+begin_src sh
sudo pacman -S wine-staging
#+end_src

** Proton-GE
Go to [[https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases][GitHub Releases]] and download the latest version, as of today 25th Feb 2023 its 7.49 so I will be using that for this guide.

#+begin_src sh
  cd .steam/steam/compatibilitytools.d/
  wget "https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/download/GE-Proton7-49/GE-Proton7-49.tar.gz"
  tar -xvf GE-Proton7-49.tar.gz
  rm *.tar.gz
#+end_src

** DXVK & VKD3D
NOTE: for this you have to use the *AUR* helper
#+begin_src sh
  paru -S dxvk-bin vkd3d-proton-bin
  ./usr/share/dxvk/setup_dxvk.sh install
  ./usr/share/vkd3d-proton/setup_vkd3d_proton.sh install
#+end_src

** vkbasalt
Similar to gamemode but specific to =VULKAN= games.

#+begin_src sh
paru -S vkbasalt lib32-vkbasalt
#+end_src

** gamescope
gamescope is pretty amazing, its a wayland based compositor for games which also removes the vsync barrier of wayland and also HDR.

#+begin_src sh
  sudo pacman -S gamescope
#+end_src

If you are on NVIDIA GPU then to use gamescope you need this script which I call it gamescope-run

#+begin_src sh
#!/bin/sh

export AMD_VULKAN_ICD=RADV
igpu=$(lspci -nn | sed -n '/VGA/{s/^.*\[//;s/\].*$//;p;q}')

gamescope --default-touch-mode 4 --prefer-vk-device $igpu --rt -w 1920 -h 1080 -W 1920 -H 1080 -f -U $@
#+end_src


* For games outside of steam
In that case you have to use this proton script I made to run those *cracked* games, yes I know it, with the same optimizations

#+begin_src sh
#!/bin/sh

PROTON="$HOME/.steam/steam/compatibilitytools.d/GE-Proton7-48/proton"
STEAM_COMPAT_DATA_PATH="$HOME/.proton" STEAM_COMPAT_CLIENT_INSTALL_PATH="$HOME/.local/share/Steam" VKD3D_CONFIG=dxr PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI=1 __VK_LAYER_NV_optimus=NVIDIA_only VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/nvidia_icd.json __GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE=1 WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR=1 WINE_FULLSCREEN_FAKE_CURRENT_RES=960x540 ENABLE_VKBASALT=1 LD_PRELOAD=$LD_PRELOAD:/usr/\$LIB/libgamemodeauto.so.0 "$PROTON" run $*
#+end_src

You can remove the =PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI=1= and other NVIDIA variables if you don't have a NVIDIA GPU.

* Done

Congratulations on completing the setup, now you can enjoy high end gaming on linux with optimized performance. Happy Gaming üòÅ.
